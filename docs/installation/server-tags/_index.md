## Single Node Installs

When performing [single-node installs]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/single-node), upgrades, or rollbacks, you can use _tags_ to install a specific version of Rancher.

### Server Tags

Rancher Server is distributed as a Docker image, which have tags attached to them. You can specify this tag when entering the command to deploy Rancher. Remember that if you use a tag without an explicit version (like `latest` or `stable`), you must explicitly pull a new version of that image tag. Otherwise, any image cached on the host will be used.

| Tag                        | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rancher/rancher:latest`   | Our latest development release. These builds are validated through our CI automation framework. These releases are not recommended for production environments. |
| `rancher/rancher:stable`   | Our newest stable release. This tag is recommended for production.                                                                                              |
| `rancher/rancher:<v2.X.X>` | You can install specific versions of Rancher by using the tag from a previous release. See what's available at DockerHub.                                                                          |

<br/>

>**Note:** The `master` tag or any tag with `-rc` or another suffix is meant for the Rancher testing team to validate.  You should not use these tags, as these builds are not officially supported.

## High Availability Installs

When installing, upgrading, or rolling back Rancher Server in a [high availability configuration]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/ha/), Rancher server is installed using a Helm chart on a Kubernetes cluster. Therefore, as you prepare to install or upgrade a high availability Rancher configuration, you must add a Helm chart repository that contains the charts for installing Rancher.

### Helm Chart Repositories

Rancher provides two different Helm chart repositories to choose from.

We align our latest and stable Helm chart repositories with the Docker tags that are used for a single node installation. 
Therefore, the `rancher-latest` repository will contain charts for all the Rancher versions that have been tagged as `rancher/rancher:latest`. 
When a Rancher version has been promoted to the `rancher/rancher:stable`, it will get added to the `rancher-stable` repository.

Each Helm chart repository is named for the labels attached to each Rancher image. In other words, the `rancher-latest` repository contains charts labeled as `rancher/rancher:latest`, the `rancher-stable` repository
contains charts labeled `rancher/rancher:stable`, etc.)

Type | Command to Add the Repo | Description of the Repo
-----------|-----|-------------
rancher-latest   | `helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest` | Adds a repository of Helm charts for the latest versions of Rancher. We recommend using this repo for testing out new Rancher builds.
rancher-stable  | `helm repo add rancher-stable https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/stable` | Adds a repository of Helm charts for older, stable versions of Rancher. We recommend using this repo for production environments.
<br/>
Instructions on when to select these repos are available below in [Switching to a Different Helm Chart Repository](#switching-to-a-different-helm-chart-repository).

> **Note:** The introduction of the `rancher-latest` and `rancher-stable` Helm Chart repositories was introduced after Rancher v2.1.0, so the `rancher-stable` repository contains some Rancher versions that were never marked as `rancher/rancher:stable`. The versions of Rancher that were tagged as `rancher/rancher:stable` prior to v2.1.0 are v2.0.4, v2.0.6, v2.0.8. Post v2.1.0, all charts in the `rancher-stable` repository will correspond with any Rancher version tagged as `stable`.

### Helm Chart Versions

Up until the initial release of the Helm chart for Rancher v2.1.0, the version of the Helm chart matched the Rancher version (i.e `appVersion`).

Since there are times where the Helm chart will require changes without any changes to the Rancher version, we have moved to a versioning scheme using `yyyy.mm.<build-number>` for the Helm charts.

Run `helm search rancher` to view which Rancher version will be launched for the your Helm chart.  

```
NAME                      CHART VERSION    APP VERSION    DESCRIPTION                                                 
rancher-latest/rancher    2018.10.1            v2.1.0      Install Rancher Server to manage Kubernetes clusters acro...
```

### Switching to a Different Helm Chart Repository

After installing Rancher, if you want to change which Helm chart repository to install Rancher from, you will need to follow these steps.

1. List the current Helm chart repositories.

    ```
    helm repo list

    NAME          	      URL                                              
    stable        	      https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
    rancher-<CHART_REPO>	https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/<CHART_REPO>
    ```

2. Remove the existing Helm Chart repository that contains your charts to install Rancher, which will either be `rancher-stable` or `rancher-latest` depending on what you had initially added.

    ```
    helm repo remove rancher-<CHART_REPO>
    ```

3. Add the Helm chart repository that you want to start installing Rancher from. Replace `<CHART_REPO>` with the chart repository that you want to use (i.e. `latest` or `stable`).

    ```
    helm repo add rancher-<CHART_REPO> https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/<CHART_REPO>
    ```

4. Continue to follow the steps to [upgrade Rancher]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/upgrades/ha-server-upgrade-helm/) from the new Helm chart repository.
