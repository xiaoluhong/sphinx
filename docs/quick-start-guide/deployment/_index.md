The following are the current guides for provisioning Rancher Server and a cluster:

- [DigitalOcean Quick Start](./digital-ocean-qs) - We provide you with a Terraform configuration file that completely automates the set up of the Rancher Server and registers a cluster for you to get started with.

- [Amazon AWS Quick Start](./amazon-aws-qs) - We provide you with an Amazon-specific Terraform configuration file that completely automates the set up of the Rancher Server and registers a cluster for you to get started with.

- [Vagrant Quick Start](./quickstart-vagrant) - We provide you with a Vagrant configuration that again completely automates the set up of the Rancher Server and registers a cluster for you to get started with.

- [Manual Quick Start](./quickstart-manual-setup) - This will guide you through the process and requirements of manually setting up Rancher in any environment.
