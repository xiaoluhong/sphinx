Deploying Rancher Server
========================

The following are the current guides for provisioning Rancher Server and
a cluster:

-  `DigitalOcean Quick Start <./digital-ocean-qs>`__ - We provide you
   with a Terraform configuration file that completely automates the set
   up of the Rancher Server and registers a cluster for you to get
   started with.

-  `Amazon AWS Quick Start <./amazon-aws-qs>`__ - We provide you with an
   Amazon-specific Terraform configuration file that completely
   automates the set up of the Rancher Server and registers a cluster
   for you to get started with.

-  `Vagrant Quick Start <./quickstart-vagrant>`__ - We provide you with
   a Vagrant configuration that again completely automates the set up of
   the Rancher Server and registers a cluster for you to get started
   with.

-  `Manual Quick Start <./quickstart-manual-setup>`__ - This will guide
   you through the process and requirements of manually setting up
   Rancher in any environment.
