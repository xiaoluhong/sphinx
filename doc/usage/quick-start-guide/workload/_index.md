These Quick Start Guides will walk you through deployment of an application. Then they will show you how to expose the application so that you can access it from outside the cluster.

- [Workload with Ingress Quick Start](./quickstart-deploy-workload-ingress): Create a workload and then expose it using an Ingress.

- [Workload with NodePort Quick Start](./quickstart-deploy-workload-nodeport): Create a workload and then expose it using a Nodeport.
